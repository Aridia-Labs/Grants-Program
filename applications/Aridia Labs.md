## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful W3F grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- Aridia Labs - Web3 infrastructure company.
- Creating a Digital Infrastructure to close the gap between the Web2 and Web3 gaming industries.
- We are building a FPS PvP with cross-chain compatibility and will include polkadot as one of the supported chains.
- We've always been big on gaming, and we saw a big oppurtunity and we decided to be one of the first movers.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XneicG58ByzlcEM1fgyq8XrIuQQjleLD?usp=sharing This link contains all of our public visuals to Everlasting.
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
    This info isn't yet planned out
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
    Unity
    C#
    SignalR
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
    Not developed yet
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XneicG58ByzlcEM1fgyq8XrIuQQjleLD?usp=sharing should be in this link.
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
    Not relevant
- This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious
    Not relevant

Things that shouldn’t be part of the application (see also our [FAQ](../docs/faq.md)):
- The (future) tokenomics of your project 
- For non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits
- Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
    The game will support Polkadot and after the game is fully launched the infrastructure will also include support to Polkadot for any other game developer to use.
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
    Gaming audience at first, then game studios or game developers.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
    Infrastructure to help onboard web2 users to web3 and help web2 companies build on web3
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
    There is a .NET libarary that could be user however; we are different in multiple ways.
    1. We offer better UX for end users and developers
    2. We will also provide the user base for the the people who use our infrastructure
    3. Cross-chain
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
    Building infrastructure is a race at this point, however; we are unique because we target the larger audience which is the web2 audience. We are doing what Epic Games did that enabled them to compete with Steam. Build a game that is fun to play, gather data about the game revenue and user metrics. This data would be used to convince web2 game companies make a game that is web3.

## Development Status :open_book:

We have only built demos/PoCs to show case how everything is going to look like and help us with our seed round. Everything will be available in the drive linked above.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

> :exclamation: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 1 year
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  4-8 more after seed round
- **Total Costs:** $500,000 is the ask for our seed round (PD is in the drive link) however; from this grant we ask for $25,000 to have polkadot integrated into our infrastructure and our game. 
### Milestone 1 Example — Basic functionality

- **Estimated duration:** 3-4 months
- **FTE:**  3
- **Costs:** $25,000

> :exclamation: **The default deliverables 0a-0d below are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| **0a.** | MIT
| **0b.** | Documentation | Our infrastructure will include a gitbook documentation on how get started with it. Our game will have a in-game tutorial to teach users how to play.
| **0c.** | Testing and Testing Guide | We have a community of over 5,000 NFT holders and total 10,000+ members that will assist us with testing the game which will have in-game tutorials.
| **0d.** | Docker |No docker files are invovled with this.
| 0e. | Article | Yes we will!
| 1. | Substrate module: We will create a system that will be used in our Everlasting game that enables players to interact with the polkadot chain. The PvP section of the game would allow players to use that chain to play against other people. This infrastructure would be extracted and made more generic to be handling any interaction on the polkadot blockchain.


## Future Plans

- Started our seed round and are meeting VCs to raise $500k for a 6 months runway to help us develop the game fully and the infrastructure
